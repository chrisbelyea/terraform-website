# Team Membership API

-> **Note**: These API endpoints are in beta and are subject to change.

The Team Membership API is used to add or remove users from teams. The [Team API](./teams.html) is used to create or destroy teams.

## Add a User to Team

This method adds multiple users to a team. Both users and teams must already exist.

| Method | Path           |
| :----- | :------------- |
| POST | /teams/:team_id/relationships/users |

### Parameters

- `team_id` (`string: <required>`) - The team ID of the team to add the users to. Team must already exit.
- `user_id` (`string: <required>`) - The user ID of all the team members to add.

    { "type": "users", "id": "myusername" },
  ]
}
```
